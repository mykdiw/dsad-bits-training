    "A Queue is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. That is, elements can be inserted at any time, but only the element that has been in the queue the longest can be next removed.\n",
    "We usually say that elements enter a queue at the back and are removed from the front. A metaphor for this terminology is a line of people waiting to get on an amusement park ride. People waiting for such a ride enter at the back of the line and get on the ride from the front of the line. There are many other applications of queues (see Figure 6.4). Stores, theaters, reservation centers, and other similar services typically process customer requests according to the FIFO principle. A queue would therefore be a logical choice for a data structure to handle calls to a customer service center, or a wait-list at a restaurant. FIFO queues are also used by many computing devices, such as a networked printer, or a Web server responding to requests."
